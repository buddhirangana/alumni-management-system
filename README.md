# Alumni Management System

The Alumni Management System project in PHP is an advanced initiative designed to help university management efficiently manage alumni records. The aim of this project is to create an online dashboard for the Alumni Management System. It facilitates the management of both recent and former graduates, allowing for the effective registration, searching, and organization of alumni information.
